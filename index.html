          A force-sensitive human male, was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic
          Civil War during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his companions, Princess
          Leia Organa and Captain Han Solo, Skywalker served on the side of the Alliance to Restore
          the Republic—an organization committed to the downfall of Emperor Palpatine and the
          restoration of democracy. Following the war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was
          remembered as one of the greatest Jedi in galactic history.
